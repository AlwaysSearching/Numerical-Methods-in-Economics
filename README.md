# Numerical-Methods-in-Economics
A Series of Jupyter Notebooks implementing and visualizing the various numerical methods found in the textbook "Numerical Methods in Economics" by Kenneth L. Judd. Most Notebooks will use Python, however some will hopefully be written using [Julia](https://julialang.org/). These Notebooks will also try to include relevent topics that were not included in the text, and additional references will be added as needed.

Notebooks currently depend on the following python packages:
- autograd
- matplotlib
- numpy
- plotly
